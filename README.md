# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Data Cleaning and EDA (Task 2)

This repository contains my work for **Task 2** of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, where I perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal of this task is to explore the relationships between variables, identify patterns, and uncover trends in the data.

## Task Overview

For Task 2:
1. Cleaned the Titanic dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and other irregularities.
2. Performed an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize trends, distributions, and relationships between variables such as age, gender, ticket class, and survival.

### Key Steps:
- **Data Cleaning**: Managed missing values, filled in missing data for columns like `Age` and `Cabin`, and removed any duplicate entries.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: 
    - Visualized the distribution of passenger sex, ages, class and survival.
    - Visualized the distribution of passenger survival rates based on sex, ages (I used 4 diffrent categories to make age groups).
    - Created scatter plots to explore relationships between continuous variables like `Age` and `Fare`.
    - Analyzed survival rates based on different ticket classes and other key features.

## Visualizations

1. **Age, Sex, Pclass Distribution**: A histogram showing the age, gender and class distribution of Titanic passengers.
2. **Survival by Gender**: A bar chart comparing survival rates of male and female passengers.
3. **Survival by Age**: A bar chart comparing survival rates of 4 different age groups.
   - Children: 0-12 years
   - Teenagers: 13-19 years
   - Adults: 20-64 years
   - Elderly: 65 years and older
5. **Scatter Plot of Age vs Fare**: A scatter plot showing the relationship between passengers' age and fare, categorized by survival.

## Knowledge Gained

This task helped me improve my skills in:
- Data cleaning by handling missing values, inconsistent data types, and duplicates.
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships in datasets.
- Creating meaningful visualizations to convey insights clearly and effectively.
